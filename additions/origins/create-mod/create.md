# Create

The Create mod is very complex, although with some basic knowledge it becomes easy to understand. I will not go into detail about every component in the Create mod, if you would like to see about that then you can check either [the Create mod wiki](https://create.fandom.com/) (fandom 🤮) or the in game Ponder tool, which goes into great detail about each and every feature within the Create mod. This page will be used to show information that is different on this server specifically, such as config changes, or tips and tricks if I'm feeling like it.
